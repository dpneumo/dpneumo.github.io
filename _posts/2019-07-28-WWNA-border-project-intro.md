WWNA received a grant from the City of Arlington to repair and upgrade our borders along Arkansas Lane and along Perkins Place. The application process began at the first of the year and culminated with approval to start June 1. Our goal is to have the project completed this Fall.

Design Goals:
  1. Improve border appearance to reflect the beauty of our homes.

  2. Make the borders a pleasant walking experience.

  3. Transition to native plants where possible.

  4. Reduce water consumption.

  5. Reduce the cost of maintenance.

This Summer we are focussing on cleanup, irrigation repairs and installation of trellises. Beginning September when the heat of the summer is mostly behind us we will start on plantings.

We are including some documentation of the border as it progresses. See the menu to the left. The planting plan is not yet in a format that can be shown here yet. We hope to have that up quickly.
