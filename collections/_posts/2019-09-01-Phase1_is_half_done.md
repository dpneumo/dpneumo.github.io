With a grant from the City of Arlington we began the WWNA Border Beautification Project in early June. We perceive the project to be more extensive than covered by the grant and our contribution this year. We conceive the current work under the grant as Phase 1 of a two year project and will be applying for a grant to assist completion of the entire envisioned project this fall as Phase 2.

Phase 1 of the Border Beautification Project is at the half way point. Weeds, invasive plants, and bushes that would interfere with placement of the trellises were removed. The irrigation system was repaired and in some area upgraded. The 18 trellises were installed along Arkansas Lane. Extensive weeding was done and mulch was placed over the planting beds on Perkins Place and Arkansas Lane. We have done minimal plant relocation and new plantings to avoid the hot dry period of the summer. Those tasks will begin in September.

The second half of phase 1 will begin early in September with extension of the rock border eastward along Arkansas Lane toward Perkins Place. The intent is to improve erosion control there. A few areas of erosion along the fences on Perkins Place will also be addressed. Some bushes along Arkansas Lane are to be relocated within their beds and others will be removed. This is in part to reduce their 'overhang' of the walk way and to provide space for plantings expected to occur in Phase 2 of our project.

In October we will complete our Phase 1 plantings into the Arkansas Lane and Perkins Place beds. We must complete Phase 1 of the Border Beautification Project by October 31 in order to be able to apply for a grant for Phase 2 on November 1. There will be some pressure to complete this but we believe we can do it.
