At dawn flags were placed along Arkansas Lane and Perkins Place and in front of many houses throughout the neighborhood.

There are 105 homes within the Waterwood neighborhood. Almost half now participate in the flag display on Memorial Day, Flag Day, July 4th, Labor Day and September 11th.

We invite everyone in the neighborhood to participate with us. Purchase a flag and the Flag Crew will handle the details of setting up, taking down and storage. Talk with Troy Ross about the details.
