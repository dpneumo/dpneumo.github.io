The City of Arlington requires that we demonstrate neighborhood support for a project to be eligible for a Neighborhood Grant. We will be knocking on your door in the next week or 2 to ask you to sign a petition indicating your support for the purposes of our Neighborhood Beautification Project Phase 2 grant proposal.

The petition text:

>We want to apply for a grant from the City of Arlington to:
<br>
>  • Continue the border beautification begun with the grant from 2019
<br>
>  • Continue planting native plants in open areas from the Approved Plant List of Arlington
<br>
>  • These plants would beautify and benefit the natural environment
<br>
>  • Continue to improve the borders by removing stumps and diverting one spring water outlet that drains over the sidewalk on Arkansas.

In February this year we applied to the city for a $25000 grant for our Neighborhood Beautification Project. In competition with several other projects we received $18000. We scaled back the project to fit the new budget and reconceived the project as consisting of 2 phases. Arlington's grant process has given us encouragement to with the second grant request. This petition is one of many items that must be part of the request when submitted at the end of October. As planting maps are developed they will be posted here.
