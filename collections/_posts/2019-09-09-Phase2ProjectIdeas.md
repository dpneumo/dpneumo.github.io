This is a list of items we currently plan to put into a Neighborhood Beautification grant request to the City of Arlington. These items will complete the planned border project. We welcome any comments. This web site does not support commenting so please speak to us directly or send us a note at 6004 Englishoak Dr.

  1. Remove sage bushes at corner of Perkins Pl. and Englishoak and replace with lower perennials. Improves visibility from Englishoak Dr to meet Arlingtonâ€™s requirements.

  2. Plant dwarf yaupon bushes along fencing on Perkins Pl. Improves appearance and protects fencing.

  3. Plant dwarf yaupon bushes behind Waterwood Estates sign at Arkansas and Perkins PL.

  4. Plant pink skull cap in front part of bed at Waterwood Sign at Arkansas and Perkins Pl.

  5. Plant Lawn Sedge border, Carex Leavenworth, along front of all beds except ones at Perkins Pl and Englishoak, the bed outlined by rock on Perkins Place, and the front bed at the Arkansas and Perkins Pl Waterwood sign.

  6. Divert spring water on Arkansas to street.

  7. Stump removal along Perking Pl.

  8. Plant holly ferns under each of the large yaupons on Arkansas.

  9. Add large yaupon next to telephone pole on Arkansas to balance plants in that bed.

  10. Add more Anthony Waterer spireas to Arkansas beds for balance.

  11. Plant dwarf sage and red Salvia gregii in the rock outlined bed on Perkins Pl.

  12. Signs to remind others to pick up after dogs.

  13. Add master valve and flow sensor controlled by controller for the irrigation system. Will allow the controller to automatically turn watering off to a zone when a leak is detected. We have already had instances of broken irrigation heads wasting large (expensive) volumes of water.
