There have been some questions about maintenance of the border along Arkansas Lane and Perkins Place.

1. ***The weeds are growing back into the planting beds along Arkansas Lane and Perkins Place. What is being done about this?***

   Jose was hired this spring to for mowing and maintenance. I asked for bids from 3 other companies including the group doing the work last year. Jose's bid was much more reasonable than any others. Because the work along Arkansas Lane appeared likely to be disruptive of a regular schedule we contracted for mowing & edging on Perkins Place plus an hour/week weeding 1/4 of the beds in a cycle. Additional weeding would be done at request at a somewhat higher hourly rate. Though Jose has been asked to do some additional weeding, the weeds have progressed faster than he has.

   I have asked Jose to increase the time he spends on the Arkansas Land beds. He seems to have become busy enough that available hours are limited. I have also elected to do spraying to gain some control over the most persistent weeds. I sprayed the weeds with the blue flowers Monday with broad leaf weed killer. That product is effective and takes 2-4 weeks to work. As you may know if you have that weed in your yard, it regrows from nodules on the roots if simply pulled. Digging these out would be time consuming and expensive. These weeds were here from prior years. We had hoped to not use poisons but that appears unavoidable. I also used SedgeHammer on the nutsedge which presents a similar problem. Those are already turning yellow. There are areas where digging out the weeds is the only option in order to not damage desired plants. Some of that will be addressed by Jose. In other areas in late September and early October when plants are moved or removed as part of the project weeds will be dug out.

2. ***Why is the strip along Arkansas Lane being mowed by Allen Hale?***

   It has been called to our attention (by Allen and others) that Allen has been mowing the strip by the street on his own initiative. I was not aware. In mid spring I was told by Randy Villarreal, a supervisor for Arlington Parks and Recreation, that the city would take responsibility for mowing the strip. The WWNA board decided to go with the free city service mowing that strip, understanding that the mowing would occur every 2-3 weeks. There were some early misses for that schedule which Allen kindly covered and alerted Mitch. I contacted Randy and was assured the city would begin the mowing which did appear to happen.

   When I learned that Allen was again mowing out of frustration at the tall grasses, I called Randy about their schedule. He said his mowers saw Allen mowing and they quit mowing. The city mowing schedule this year has been every 3 weeks. It appears that is not quite often enough. Arlington Parks and Rec are applying for funding from the city to allow them to mow every 2 weeks. The growth rate for the grasses also reflects the watering schedule. We are working to make that more appropriately match the real need. That will include adding some ability to adapt to current weather and to water content in the soil. Edging will also be addressed.

   A big thanks to Allen for doing the mowing. I will monitor the city mowing. If they cannot keep up the schedule it may become appropriate to add that to the landscape maintenance duties.

3. ***Why did you remove the sage bushes around the light pole at the top of Perkins Place?***

   The city finally noticed that the sages were violating their rules concerning sight line obstruction at corners. We could have trimmed them deeply but they would not look good and would require frequent trimming to keep them "in compliance." We will replace them with a more mannerly red *Salvia gregii*

4. ***The city gave us a lot of money for the border. Why not use some to pay for more aggressive landscape maintenance?***

   One thing that perhaps has not been well communicated is that the city does NOT allow maintenance of the border to come out of the grant funds. The maintenance must come from the dues you pay to WWNA. However, one of the multiple project goals is to make maintenance easier and less expensive. We are on the way toward that goal. Just not there yet.

   The weed removal done just before mulching was treated as bed prep and not maintenance.

   Yes, we have problems with weeds now but please keep in mind that we started with mostly overgrown bushes on Arkansas, many invasive weeds and a broken irrigation system. We are tackling those problems and, we hope, improving the border for the long term. We always appreciate positive support and problem solving feedback.

5. ***So what are you working on?***

   Mitch and I have been very busy.

  * Updating the website which now has pictures of the process so far with the 2019 grant and a list of plants included in the 2020 grant proposal.
  * Preparing planting layouts of what the finished border will look like. These will soon be posted to the website. The city wants documentation of planning, progress and completion of the project. Mitch is taking advantage of that work to provide content for this website, [wwna.org](https://wwna.org).
  * The [midpoint progress report](../Expenditure_Report/index.html) for the 2019 grant included accounting for funds received, spent to date and planned.
  * The 2020 application is due the first week of November. We are working hard to have that application completed and submitted ahead of time. The 2019 grant work must be complete when the 2020 grant application is submitted.
  * Preparing the quantity of paperwork necessary to apply to the state of Texas for sales tax exemption for WWNA. On paper we should qualify but at present we do not have that exemption. If we obtain sales tax exempt status we can save 8%.


Please let us know of any problems you observe with the borders. Many thanks to the walkers who are picking up trash they find. Thank you again, Allen.
