The large Yaupons along Arkansas Lane from Perkins place westward will be trimmed into treeform. This will keep the Yaupons from impinging on the sidewalk and eventually will provide a shaded walk way.

Plantings along Arkansas Lane will be confined to the stretch between Perkins Place and Lakehurst Dr.
