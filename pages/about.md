The City of Arlington Texas offers a Neighborhood Grant program designed to encourage neighborhoods to work together to improve the neighborhod in some way. The Waterwood Neighborhood Association applied in February 2019 for a grant to upgrade the border along Arkansas Lane and along Perkins Place. We were approved to receive $18,000 for the project. Work begins on June 1.
